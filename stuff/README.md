# Our Printf

## Introduction

>We took the challenge of creating our very own "printf" function. We wanted to include most of the capabilities that are offered and add a few custom options as well.

## Run the function

>Run the function using the prototype "int _printf(const char *format, ...)"

## Format Specifiers
<ul>
  <li>%c: The int argument is converted to an unsigned char</li>
  <l1>%s: Characters are written up and until the terminating null byte</li>
  <li>%d,i:  The int argument is converted to signed decimal notation. The precision, if any, gives the minimum number of digits that       ``must appear; if the converted value requires fewer digits, it
    is padded on the left with zeros. </li>
</ul>
