# Our Printf

## Introduction

>We took the challenge of creating our very own "printf" function. We wanted to include most of the capabilities that are offered and add a few custom options as well.

## Run the function

>Run the function using the prototype "int _printf(const char *format, ...)"

## Format Specifiers
<ul>
  <li>%c: The int argument is converted to an unsigned char</li>
  <l1>%
